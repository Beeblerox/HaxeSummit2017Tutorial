## What is Haxe?

A programming language designed to be a multi-target. Multi-target means a Haxe program can be (cross-)compiled into different binary or source code formats. This makes Haxe highly platform independent.

### What problems a multi-target language can solve?

There are many different application platforms, like Android, iOS, Windows, Mac, and Linux. The following scenarios are very common:

 * To develop an application that can be run on multiple platforms for maximizing the potential user amount.

Most platforms officially support only 1-2 languages, e.g. Android supports Java/Kotlin, the web supports JavaScript. Using a non-multi-target language that is not officially supported usually implies poor runtime performance and poor development experience. For example, although it is possible to write a JavaScript application for Android, a Java Android app will usually run faster and consume less power. Accessing Android APIs in JavaScript also requires wrappers, which easily become outdated and impose additional runtime/development overhead. That means, traditionally, targeting multiple platforms requires using multiple different languages.
